## face.evoLVe for Face Recognition

### Introduction

This repo provides a comprehensive face recognition library for face related analytics \& applications, including face alignment (detection, landmark localization, affine transformation, *etc.*), data processing (augmentation, data balancing, normalization, *etc.*), various backbones (ResNet, IR-SE, ResNeXt, SE-ResNeXt, DenseNet, LightCNN, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, DPN, *etc.*), various losses (Softmax, Focal, Center, SphereFace, CosineFace, AmSoftmax, ArcFace, Triplet, *etc.*) and bags of tricks for improving performance (training refinements, model tweaks, knowledge distillation, *etc.*).

The data before \& after alignment, source codes and trained models are all provided.

This repo can help researchers/engineers develop deep face recognition models and algorithms quickly for practical use.
